# Script_Picture
Can take a file, look a type of file, select that type. open the picture, fuse them and transform them in pdf
you need to call the py program
if you don't know you can oppen the cmd and write : 
py path_to_the_main.py path_to_the_picture_folder
press enter

ALL THE PDF OF THE FOLDER WILL BE TAKE 
PUT IN THE CORRECT ORDER ALL THE PICTURE IN THE FOLDER (like 1.png, 2.png,3.png ...)
IT WORK WITH PNG BUT TECHNICALLY COULD WORK WITH OTHER IF YOU CHANGE IT WITH PYCHARM

then it will creat a folder "Final_image" and a PDF "final.PDF"

you will need to import in python :
Sys 
from PIL import Image
